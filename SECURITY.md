## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Responsible Disclosure

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Email:** security@faceless-youtube.local (or your actual security email)
2. **Include:**
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **24 hours:** Initial response acknowledging your report
- **72 hours:** Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days:** Detailed response with remediation timeline
- **30 days:** Security patch released (for critical vulnerabilities)

### Security Update Process

1. Vulnerability confirmed and assessed
2. Fix developed and tested
3. Security advisory published (if appropriate)
4. Patch released across supported versions
5. Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique values for `SECRET_KEY`
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use different credentials for dev/staging/production

2. **Database Security**

   - Use strong database passwords
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
   - Restrict database access to specific IP addresses
   - Regularly backup your database

3. **API Keys**

   - Store API keys in environment variables, not in code
   - Use read-only API keys when possible
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies
   - Revoke unused API keys

4. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Run `pip-audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
   - Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**

   ```python
   # Always validate user input
   from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

   class VideoInput(BaseModel):
       title: str

       @validator('title')
       def validate_title(cls, v):
           if len(v) > 200:
               raise ValueError('Title too long')
           return v
   ```

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**

   ```python
   # GOOD: Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries
   db.query(Video).filter(Video.id == video_id).first()

   # BAD: Never use string formatting for SQL
   # db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM videos WHERE id = {video_id}")
   ```

3. **XSS Prevention**

   - Sanitize all user-generated content
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Escape HTML in templates

4. **Authentication**

   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Implement rate limiting on login endpoints
   - Use JWT with short expiration times
   - Implement refresh token rotation

5. **Secrets Management**

   ```python
   # GOOD: Load from environment
   import os
   api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

   # BAD: Never hardcode secrets
   # api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
   ```

## üîê Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Encryption at Rest**

   - Database credentials are encrypted in Platform model
   - API keys stored in environment variables (not encrypted at rest)
   - Consider using AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault for production

2. **Authentication**

   - JWT-based authentication (implementation pending)
   - Password hashing with bcrypt (implementation pending)
   - OAuth 2.0 for third-party platforms

3. **Rate Limiting**

   - API rate limiting (implementation pending)
   - Asset scraper rate limiting (implemented)

4. **CORS**
   - CORS configured for specified origins only
   - No wildcard (\*) origins in production

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Intrusion detection system (IDS)
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Secrets management integration
- [ ] SIEM integration

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Scans

We run the following security scans on every PR:

1. **Dependency Scanning:** `pip-audit` checks for known vulnerabilities
2. **Static Analysis:** `bandit` for Python security issues
3. **Secret Scanning:** GitHub secret scanning for exposed credentials
4. **Container Scanning:** Docker image vulnerability scanning

### Manual Security Reviews

Security reviews are required for:

- Authentication/authorization changes
- Database schema changes
- External API integrations
- Cryptography implementations
- File upload/download features
- Admin/privileged operations

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All dependencies updated and scanned
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Logging configured (without sensitive data)
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Access controls reviewed
- [ ] Intrusion detection enabled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## üÜò Incident Response

If you detect a security incident:

1. **Isolate:** Take affected systems offline if necessary
2. **Document:** Record all relevant information
3. **Notify:** Contact security@faceless-youtube.local immediately
4. **Preserve:** Don't delete logs or evidence
5. **Remediate:** Follow security team's guidance
