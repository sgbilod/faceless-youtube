âœ… Tested successfully
diagnostics.py (342 lines) + diagnostic_report.txt - System health check

6 test suites (config, dependencies, filesystem, databases, APIs, services)
âœ… Executed successfully
Results: 50% healthy (3/6 components), 20/26 tests passed
Unified Startup System:

start.py (286 lines) - Python launcher with ServiceManager

Single-command startup with auto-dependency installation
ISSUES_FOUND.md - Comprehensive issues report

6 Critical Issues (must fix before packaging)
6 Warnings (should fix)
4 Recommendations (nice to have)
Quick fix checklist included
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FINDINGS
Top Blockers:
28 Python packages missing (moviepy, google-api-python-client, sentence-transformers, etc.)
All Node.js packages missing (auto-fixed by start.py)
video_assembler.py syntax error (line 558: await outside async)
PostgreSQL not running + password not set
MongoDB not running
YouTube OAuth credentials need validation
Diagnostic Status: 50% healthy (3/6 components pass)

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS
To start the application:

The startup script will:

âœ… Validate prerequisites
âœ… Auto-install Node.js dependencies
âœ… Start FastAPI backend on port 8000
âœ… Start React frontend on port 3000
âœ… Handle graceful shutdown
