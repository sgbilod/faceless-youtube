## Deployment Steps

### 1. Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
- [ ] Monitor logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Load test with realistic traffic
- [ ] Verify all integrations working

### 2. Pre-Production Checks
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Tag release in git (`git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Production release"`)
- [ ] Build Docker images (if using containers)
- [ ] Push images to registry
- [ ] Update DNS/load balancer (if needed)

### 3. Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Verify application starts successfully
- [ ] Check `/health` endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Check `/metrics` endpoint accessible
- [ ] Test critical user flows

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Monitor error rates (< 1% error rate)
- [ ] Check response times (p95 < 500ms)
- [ ] Verify security headers present
- [ ] Test rate limiting working
- [ ] Confirm audit logging capturing events
- [ ] Check all external integrations

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Response time p95 < 500ms
- [ ] CPU usage < 70%
- [ ] Memory usage < 80%
- [ ] Database connection pool healthy
- [ ] Redis cache hit rate > 80%

### Logs to Review
- [ ] No unexpected errors in logs
- [ ] Authentication events logging correctly
- [ ] Request logging includes timing
- [ ] No security warnings

### User Experience
- [ ] Video generation working end-to-end
- [ ] YouTube upload successful
- [ ] Script generation responding quickly
- [ ] API responses within SLA

---

## Rollback Plan

### Preparation
- [ ] Previous version tagged and accessible
- [ ] Database backup recent (< 1 hour old)
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested in staging

### If Issues Occur

**CRITICAL (Immediate Rollback):**
- Production completely down
- Data corruption detected
- Security breach discovered

**HIGH (Rollback within 1 hour):**
- Error rate > 10%
- Critical feature broken
- Performance degradation > 50%

**MEDIUM (Fix forward if possible):**
- Non-critical bugs
- Minor performance issues
- UI glitches

### Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Stop current application
2. [ ] Restore previous version
3. [ ] Rollback database migrations (if needed)
4. [ ] Verify previous version working
5. [ ] Check for data inconsistencies
6. [ ] Monitor for errors
7. [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders

## Security Checklist

### Headers

- [ ] `Referrer-Policy` set
- [ ] `Permissions-Policy` restricts features

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens expire (reasonable TTL)
- [ ] Refresh tokens implemented
- [ ] Password hashing using bcrypt
- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoint
- [ ] Failed login attempts logged

### API Security
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication (except public)
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Input validation on all requests
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
